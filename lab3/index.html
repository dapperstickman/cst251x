	<h1> Lab 3 - File Structure </h1>
	<p> The purpose of this lab is to help students learn how to organize their files
	and to figure out how to link one folder in a project to another, regardless
of what the folder's position might be.</p>

<h2> Challenges </h2>
I did not have many issues when it came to creating these files. The only problem I <head>
	was when I tried to make a link to the labs. I only mispelled a link. Other than that, not many problems were encountered.

	<h3> Results </h3>
	<p> Everything came out pretty good. I have some screenshots from my work. </p>
