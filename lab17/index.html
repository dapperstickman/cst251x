      <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>We are now finally gettting into working with how to properly work with CSS layouts. This time though, the main treat isn't going to be on the main lab page. The trick is that will will alter this webpage in other htmls to see how it can work diffrently. So this page is only content. A filler page. </p>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>New techniques means new problems. Mislinks, somethings don't really work like they should, and somethings don't work at all.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>This webpage is just a base. No too much interesting stuff, but not just plain.</p>
