    <h1>Challenge</h1>
      <p>Another Lab dedicated to trying to figure out the inner workings of the CSS code.
      Still a little unsure on how on everything that works within the code, but I have a fair idea</p>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>Another coding issue cames with another lab. Some misnaming, some things don't line up,
      nothing crazy like before, but enough that some extra work needs to be done.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>Another webpage that is the result of my work. A few new things, nothing to special, but enough to show that I learned a few things. Border, images, pading, margins, spicy stuff. Maybe even spice up the homepage.</p>
