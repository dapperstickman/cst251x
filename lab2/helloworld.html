<h1> Hello World </h1>

<p> What there is to know about us... My name is Phillip Guaracha. I am from San Juan Bautista and came to this class hoping to learn more about the trade of messing around with code. It is pretty straight forward so far, and I hope to maintain this path. This is my second year at CSUMB and these online courses can be a bit confusing at times. I wish this whole Coronavirus thing would end already. Even though I don't like them, I would prefer classrooms than zoom meetings.
  My Partner is Ross Maeder.I (Ross) enjoy playing basketball, CoD Modern Warfare, and hanging with friends. I am also largely into fashion, and hope to be a fashion design one day. I am from Orange County. Both of our majors are Communication Design Major and we don't have much experience when it comes to coding. We are both hoping that we will learn more about it in this class. We both also enjoy videogames.</p>
