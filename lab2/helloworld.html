<p> What there is to know about me... My name is Phillip Guaracha. I am from San Juan Bautista and came to this class hoping to learn more about the trade of messing around with code. It is pretty straight forward so far, and I hope to maintain this path. This is my second year at CSUMB and these online courses can be a bit confusing at times. I wish this whole Coronavirus thing would end already. Even though I don't like them, I would prefer classrooms than zoom meetings.
  My Partner is Ross Maeder. He is from Orange County. Like me, he is a Communication Design Major and doesn't have much experience when it comes to coding. We are both hoping that we will learn more about it in this class. We both also enjoy videogames.
