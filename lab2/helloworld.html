<h1> Hello World </h1>
<p> What there is to know about me... My name is Phillip Guaracha. I am from San Juan Bautista and came to this class hoping to learn more about the trade of messing around with code. It is pretty straight forward so far, and I hope to maintain this path. This is my second year at CSUMB and these online courses can be a bit confusing at times. I wish this whole Coronavirus thing would end already. Even though I don't like them, I would prefer classrooms than zoom meetings.
