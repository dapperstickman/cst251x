	<p>Hello. My name is Phillip Guaracha. I will be your coder for this website. I live
		in San Juan Bautista and currently attend CSUMB. I have little experience when it comes to coding
	but I am willing to learn more. I like to able in the arts such as drawing, photo editing
and the like. When it comes to art, I tend to follow a minimalist approach. As in, I try to use the least
amount of items to try and portray my message. </p>

		<p>My interests include: Gaming on either PC or Xbox, a little bit of reading,and just
		messing around with diffrent programs like SFM adobr products, and anything else that interests me. I tend to spend
	most of my time on a laptop, even before zoom classes. I have hit a low spot in things to do. I was once in scouts,
but I eventually ranked out of it. With this whole Coronavirus going on, my options are limited.</p>
