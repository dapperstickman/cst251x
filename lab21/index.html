    <h1>Challenge</h1>
      <p>This lab isn't actually a focus on creating or editing CSS or HTML. It is just a place to show off ideas for a website design, so nothing fancy. Atleast for the moment.</p>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p>I got some good ideas. Sometimes it doesn't hit when I need it to, so I might come up with something better a week later.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p>The feedback I got for my images was pretty common. Much of what was shown by my teammates were based on what we would like to do, while mine was based on we we had the ability to do. They approved of the designs, jsut to go a bit more into detail, which we are already doing for this lab.</p>
