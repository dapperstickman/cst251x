      <h1>Problems</h1>
      <p class="problems">Since this is a lab, not everything in it will be easy to understand. Coding can go wrong, some files wont link correctly, mislabels will destroy you. Yay, coding. Still not 100 on how well im doing. I spent a good amount of time fiddling with some code, only to remove it as it didn't seem to work. Somethings are still out of my grasp of knowledge.</p>
      <h1>Results</h1>
      <p class="results">This webpage is the result of my work. Does it look nice, bad, not sure. Soon, I will see. It looks nice, more calm than what my last webpage. Everything is still a little wonky, but im still learning the steps of making it better.<p/>
