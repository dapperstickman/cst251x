	<h1>What is this Lab?</h1>
	<p> The point of Lab 5 is to get used to adding links to other websites. So far, we have only added images and link that are connected on a
		local area(images and links to diffrent pages on the website). Now we will added links to other website, not owned by you.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> I am not used to adding links to other webpages. It took a bit of edits to get what I wanted. The images were pretty simple as I had lots of experience putting
		them in other labs. I did have a bit of trouble when it came to adding links to other pages, especially when it came to adding links through photos, but I think I managed.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>This web page you currently see is the fruits of my labor. I have added images as well as links to other pages. I have also hidden links as images.
	I would have added many more websites, but I don't go to a lot that I would consider putting in the page. I tend to stick to the same few pages.</p>
